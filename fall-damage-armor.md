# Abstract

This experiment was set up in response to a Reddit thread where several competing views are offered about the effect of armor
on fall damage in Minecraft.

The following *will* be tested:
- Is fall damage in Minecraft affected by diamond armor?
- Is fall damage in Minecraft affected by feather falling enchanted boots?
- Do boots modify fall damage differently than other armor?

The following will *not* be tested:
- Is fall damage affected by difficulty setting
- Is fall damage affected by Protection enchantment?

## Variables
- Independent - configuration of armor worn
- Dependent - fall damage taken in Peaceful mode (according to many sources, difficulty setting does not affect fall damage
- Controls:
  - armor tier (diamond)
  - fall height
  - difficulty
  - hunger
  - armor condition
  
# Procedure

- Minecraft 1.8 was used
- Superflat creative map with cheats enabled was used
- A pillar of dirt 22 blocks high was created to maximize damage and reduce percent error
- Gamemode was switched between creative and survival to speed experiment along
- Perform trial by dropping with given armor configuration and fly back up after recording health lost

# Results

| Armor Configuration                           | Trial 1 | Trial 2 | Trial 3 | Trial 4 | Trial 5 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|---------|
| no armor                                      | 18      | 19      | 19      | 19      | 19      |
| full armor unenchanted                        | 19      | 19      | 19      | 19      | 19      |
| only boots unenchanted                        | 19      | 19      | 19      | 19      | 19      |
| all armor except boots unenchanted            | 19      | 19      | 19      | 19      | 19      |
| all armor with boots with feather falling IV  | 7       | 8       | 5       | 11      | 11      |
| no armor except boots with feather falling IV | 5       | 11      | 13      | 9       | 7       |

# Conclusions

- enchanted armor does not affect fall damage
- fall damage can vary by a small amount with armor - probably due to hearts regenerating immediately after damage taken, further research required
- fall damage can vary by a large amount with feather falling IV - odd effect, no explanation for now, futher research required
- fall damage is greatly affected by feather falling IV
- it does not matter whether boots are worn excluding the effects of feather falling IV
